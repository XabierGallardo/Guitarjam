## About
Guitarjam is a web tool that brings a tuner, a metronome and youtube in the same page.

The idea came after many years playing the guitar and needing a constant use to tune my strings, use the metronome, while using youtube to play and learn.

This website brings a simple and all-in-one solution, without needing a tuner or a metronome, without even changing the window!
